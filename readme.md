# Free Online XML Formatter

Why?

I needed to compare a [Web.config](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web.config) from
my PC with the one on the production server.

Even with ignore spaces, the diff wasn't easy to read.

I tried [FreeFormatter](http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html), but it
wasn't enough.
